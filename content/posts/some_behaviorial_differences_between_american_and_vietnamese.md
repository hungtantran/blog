Some differences that I observed exist between educated, smart Vietnamese and Americans:

* American read and, more importantly, write books more.
* Vietnamese are more flexible and adhoc when dealing with problems. I doubt that a similar version of the US supreme court, in which justices engage in highly technical, rigorously logical subtleties of each word in a constitution, can exists. Deep down, Vietnamese don't like inflexibility and rationality in social decisions. Most American are also like that but there exists some segment of elite American intellectuals who value and believe in rationality. There is no equivalent segment in Vietnam which also hold institutional power.
* Vietnamese care more about money and social status. In this case, social status include but is not limited to just money or power but also anything that ones' peers value, which can be knowledge, etiquette. Essentially, Vietnamese are more external-driven rather than internal-driven. American are too but not to the extent of Vietnamese.
* Vietnamese are more down-to-earth, pragmatic, practical, spiritual and less theoretical, intellectual, "day-dream", philosophical. May be this is why there is no Vietnamese sci-fi or fantasy genre books. There are also very few proper Vietnamese philosophers even though lots of Vietnamese like to engage in armchair philosophizing about the nature of human, relationship and society.
* More Americans are driven to explore, build things rather than trade, own things. Surprisingly few Vietnamese, even educated and smart, want to "explore" things or have "frontier" mentality.
* American as a group has more variance and more extreme samples than Vietnamese and most other cultures do in most dimensions either wealth, intelligence, knowledge, personalities, interest, behaviors, ....
