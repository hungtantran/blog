```TL;DR: My biggest takeaways is that cryptocurrency can potentially succeed because it can innovate without all the legacy system and intermediaries holding it back. Existing financial system doesn't have that luxury. It has nothing to do with technical feasibility. It has everything to do with legacy and momentum, a classic story of disruption.```

ADHD as I am, I dislikes listening to podcast. The medium conveys information at a slower speed than what I can achieve with a written article. Re-reading important paragraphs multiple times feels much more natural than clicking over and over again on the progress bar of a podcast. However, these days, many interesting people and content find themselves on the podcast medium. I suspect that the back-and-forth question-answer format of a podcast conversation is more engaging for speakers than writing out their thoughts. Because of that, once in a blue moon, I find myself engage with the medium.

Yesterday while reseaching the world of crypto and web3, I stumbled upon a [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-bankman-fried-creating-a-perfect-market/id1154105909?i=1000539035823) from Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire founder of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchange (not available in the US) I will try to summarize some of my takeaways from the podcast:
* `Frequent reflection on the status quo` does the general design of products in this space make sense? Sam raised a point that if we have to design the equities market from scratch again, what would we change?
    * 24/7 operation. It's not easy for a new equity exchange to adopt this model because there are so many intermediaries in the market e.g the exchange, market maker, broker. Change in just the exchange itself is not sufficient to make a difference. Thus, a market with lots of intermediaries not only introduces friction but also prevents disruptions and significant improvements.
    * Latency doesn't have to be sub-milliseconds since 2 economic events are unlikely to happen within that amount of time.
    * Orderbook should be public to increase transparency and efficiency.
    * Trading fee and/or tax increase the minimum barrier at which participants in the market make trade, killing liquidity, price discovery and market efficiency. For example, a trading fee of 10 basis point will kill all trades that profit less than that.
* `Crypto is a shitshow but it is improving:` The current financial system is surprisingly no less of a shit show.
* `Stablecoin is a big deal:` Fiat currency is slow due to legacy system. Stablecoin like USDC is slow if it has to interact with fiat system, which happens when at the entry and exit point of crypto to the outside world. However, if there are enough stablecoin in the system, people can derive use from it just by transferring stablecoins within the system. In that case, the velocity is fast. So cryptocurrency is useful once it reaches an escape velocity, an wide enough adoption such that it doesn't have to interact with fiat much.
* `The world only needs a few Layer-1 blockchains:` It is unclear why the world would need more than one Layer-1 blockchain. It is good for competition in the short term but in the long-term, there is no clear value. My take is that like anything else in the world, if there is enough economics incentive, there will be competitors like Coke vs Pepsi. I suspect that there won't be 1 but 2 or 3 Layer-1 successful blockchains.
* `Hybrid compute will be the future:` Compute workload will be split between on-chain and off-chain with intensive workloads reside off-chain and small but high-valued ones reside on-chain.
* `Blockchain reduces the network effect moat, allowing faster innovation:` Sam made a point that data move between platforms easier on blockchain than on traditional internet with private database. For example, a social network built on top of blockchain will store messages on the chain itself. Anyone can easily access those public messages to build a new better social network without having to overcome the initial network effect. In theory, that is correct if only a social network store most of its valuable data on-chain. However, incentive-wise speaking, I suspect no business would want to give up their moat and store their most valuable data on-chain. A social network might start out with that implementation to extract users to its vision of blockchain social network. However, as its success grows, the business is incentivizes to move more and more data off-chain. Moxie raises the same idea in his [blog post](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) that platform moves faster than protocol, and that the centralizing force is too strong to overcome. A real world example can be found in email. The SMTP protocol is fully decentralized. However, with the raise of Gmail, Outlook, how decentralized is email really in 2022? My guess is not very.
* `Ignore tail events at your own peril:` In the digital world, most of the gain resides in the long-tail so don't make the mistake of ignoring unlikely events.
