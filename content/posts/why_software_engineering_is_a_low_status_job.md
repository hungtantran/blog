Recently I have been sensing that software engineering is a low status job. Even though the popularity and income potential of software engineering is growing quickly, the social status of software engineers still seem somewhat low. For an average Joe, a software engineering doesn't have quite the same social cachet as other typical prestigious jobs in society like a doctor, a lawyer, a management consultant, an investment banker,  

I will try to go through some potential reasons why software engineering is a relatively low status job compared to its current earning potential 
* Social status is a lagging indicator of wealth and power: Software engineering is a relatively new profession: software engineering is a relatively new profession while doctor, lawyer, banker have exists for hundreds of years. While in the last 20 years, the
* Only a small number engineers like those at FAANG and top tech startups make good amount of money, on average software engineers are paid reasonably but not as high as average doctor and lawyer:
* Money is only weakly correlated with power and influence. The nature of software engineering field in particular, and engineering in general, naturally attract introverts and nerds. People with these personalities are less likely to desire power and influence. They are more likely to be happy with a job that pays well and allows them to work in peace with like-minded people. They are less likely to desire to be in the spot light, to be in position of power. They don't use their relative high income as leverage to gain power, get involved in politics, become politicians or people in position of power.
* Software engineering and other engineering fields mainly deal with highly-technical subjects, not people. Average people don't understand these subjects and aren't related to them.
