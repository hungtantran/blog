It is a common conception that the US is founded or heavily influenced by Judeo Christianity and Anglo Saxon culture. However, what exactly does that mean? The term usually conjures up some image of individualism, classical liberalism, Christian religion. Those are vague and don't sufficiently explain what concrete characteristics of American culture it brings about.

To start, let's list out some characteristics of Judeo Christianity and Anglo Saxon culture:
* Monotheism, concept of one God, omnipotent god. God is in human form, only one true god (vs Buddism there is no single god, Buddha is an enlightened one, not god)
* Moral absolutism from Ten Commandments, the belief in a higher power that is the source of morality. As opposed to Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. where there is no absolute moral code.
* Every man is born with a sin
* Atonement
* Human suffering, such as a plague, as punishment for human guilt 
* Every man is born in the image of God.
* Emphasis on community and common good?
* Suffering is core. Shouldn’t avoid suffering => encourage people to do hard things (vs Buddism avoid suffering)
* “Whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” => emphasize doing things to bring glory to God, doing things in the world (vs Buddism focuses on changing ourselves, introspection to achieve enlightenment, to fit with the natural world)
* Emphasis multiplying, having lots of kid
* Encourage missionaries, spreading Christianity to other people, outbound (vs Buddism inbound)


Second, let's list out what Judeo Christianity and Anglo Saxon culture is not:
* Polytheism: Greek gods or gods in lots of eastern culture where there can be many gods. Gods can represent natural phenomenon like ocean, river, mountain, etc.
* Moral relativism

Questions in my mind are:
* Does Judeo-Christianity actually cause Western society to be in a certain way or is it because of hidden variables (e.g. genetic, environment)? One way to try to answer is to see if a non-Western society changes meaningfully when Christianity is introduced through missionaries?
