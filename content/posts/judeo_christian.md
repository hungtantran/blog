It is a common conception that the US is founded or heavily influenced by Judeo Christianity and Anglo Saxon culture. However, what exactly does that mean? The term usually conjures up some image of individualism, classical liberalism, Christian religion. Those are vague and don't sufficiently explain what concrete characteristics of American culture it brings about.

To start, let's list out some characteristics of Judeo Christianity and Anglo Saxon culture:
* Monotheism, concept of one God, omnipotent god, human-. 
* Moral absolutism from Ten Commandments, the belief in a higher power that is the source of morality. As opposed to Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. where there is no absolute moral code.
* Every man is born with a sin
* Atonement
* Human suffering, such as a plague, as punishment for human guilt 
* Every man is born in the image of God.
* Emphasis on community and common good?

Second, let's list out what Judeo Christianity and Anglo Saxon culture is not:
* Polytheism: Greek gods or gods in lots of eastern culture where there can be many gods. Gods can represent natural phenomenon like ocean, river, mountain, etc.
* Moral relativism
