War is necessary. War is just an extreme form of competition.

* Advance humanity. Technology comes from war.
* Unite people at least on one side. There is no real collaboration without real competition. There is no extreme collaboration without extreme competition a.k.a war.
* War or a credible threat of war makes life more exciting, reminding people of value of life. Without credible threat, life gradually becomes just living death. During and after a war, there are usually a tremendous amount of culture produced as a result such as art, books, music, movies, articles. These enriches human civilization.
* War means people having different ideas willing to go to extreme to defend it, instead of a uniform, boring world.
