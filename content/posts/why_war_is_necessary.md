With the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces, people in Western and many Asian countries are united in condemning it.
 
War is necessary. War is just an extreme form of competition.
 
* Advance humanity. Technology comes from war.
* Unite people at least on one side. There is no real collaboration without real competition. There is no extreme collaboration without extreme competition a.k.a war.
* War or a credible threat of war makes life more exciting, reminding people of the value of life. Without credible threat, life gradually becomes just living death. During and after a war, there is usually a tremendous amount of culture produced as a result such as art, books, music, movies, articles. This enriches human civilization.
* War means people having different ideas willing to go to extremes to defend it, instead of a uniform, boring world.
