"Money" is made up but its liquidity/ease of exchange has real value. "Resources" including physical, digital assets and human capital are real (stock is a claim on asset, can also be considered resources). Thus, controlling of asset and liquidity are what important.

Some implications:
* When money supplies increase, liquidity increases => holding resources is better, avoid having too much money and liquidity
  * FED prints money
  * FED decreases interest rate
* When money supplies decrease, liquidity decreases => liquidity increases in its relative value, hold more money, have less resources
  * 
* People saves lots of money, more control of resources are in hands of government and companies => more investment, more production => export increases
* People saves little money, more control of resources are in hands of people => less investment, less production => import increases
