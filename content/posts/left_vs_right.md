There are a lot of efforts to compare between the left and the right views of the political spectrum like the left is pro tax, pro welfare, pro women right, minority right, communist, etc the right is anti tax, pro free speech, prot nationalism, pro capitalism, religious.

I believe those are only temporary views of each side at the moment. They are not fundamental, not at the core of the division. Some tries to go deeper and say the left is pro equality, pro novelity, pro change, the right is pro hierarchy, tradition. Those are indeed closer to the real difference. However, I still think they don't go far enough.

I believe that any large group of people are fundamental driven by emotion, not by any particular principle. The real difference between left and right is that the left is driven by envy and sympathy, the right is driven by fear and desire for power.

The left is driven mainly by a coalition of 1) people who perceive themselves as lack of power and who envy those with power and 2) people who sympathize with the former group. The right is driven mainly by a coalition of 1) people who fear for their own and their group's survival, not only in the physical sense but also in the sense of fear of the unknown, of losing freedom, losing tradition, identity, familiarity, cultural power, etc and 2) people who desire power and want to maintain the status quo. We can also argue that group (1) from the left and group (1) from the right actually have the same motive. Both fear for their own survival, but the left fears from the below position and the right fears from the status quo, the above position.

People who are principled and not driven deep down inside by one of the above emotion are exceedingly rare, even the smartest ones.
