Society has always consider work as a means to an end: to create some concrete product, or render some service. Would it make sense to start consider work as an end in itself?

Work by itself can produce some very important end "products" other than its concrete product or service output, such as, in order of importance:
* Sense of meaning
* Environment for social interaction
* Mental exercise
* Physical exercise

The counter argument to the above would be there are better ways than work to accomplish those goals. Let's list some of themes:
* Sense of meaning: Creating arts, writing books, volunteer work, religious work, charity work
* Environment for social interaction: volunteer, religious, family, friends, social clubs, forum
* Mental exercise: Reading, writing
* Physical exercise: Sports, gym

However, I would argue that except for physical exercise, the above means are not as effective as working, or at least cannot completely replace working, in bringing out the above end products.
