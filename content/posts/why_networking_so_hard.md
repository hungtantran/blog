2 characteristics of networking: Distance and heterogeneity

Making the below problem harder compare to many other computer system components:
* Performance: throughput, latency
  * Performance requirement is real so many optimization is needed. Making the real world implementation of most networking component extra complicated.
* Reliability
  * 
* Compatibility
  * So many abstraction layer to solve the problem of
  * Lack of control on so many component of the system
* Security
  * Distance, lack of control, heterogeneity, lots of abstraction makes the issue of security much harder

Because networking usually has to deal with transferring information over a much longer distance compare to other component in a computer system like CPU, GPU, memory, the above problems become much harder.
