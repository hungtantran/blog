The older I am, the more I appreciate the wisdom of the quote "Never let a good crisis go to waste." Individual people, small group, large group, a company, a society, all of them wants some small change to keep life exciting but hate large changes. Meaningful changes rarely happen from within even when it is needed. Like the proverbial "slow boiling frog," people won't make significant change if their situation deteriorate slowly. The bigger the change is needed, the bigger the crisis has to be.

The difference between big problem and crisis is the speed and concentration e.g cancer vs car accident, random shooting vs war, people dying slowly, separately because of smoking vs bombing killing a few people.

Moral of the story
* Crisis can be a good thing. Take full advantage of it to make the change you want.
* If you want to solve a big problem, you usually need a big crisis by manufacturing one or accelerating its timeline.
* Don't waste too much time, energy and emotional capital to trying to solve a large problem if you think it's not causing a proportional crisis soon.
