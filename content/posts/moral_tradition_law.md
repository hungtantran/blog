The set of acceptable behaviors for a member of a society is usually constrained by a combination of:
* Moral, tradition/social norms/religious teaching:
  * Fewer than laws in number, less specific, more flexible, broader, slower to change
  * Enforced mainly by both social pressure and personal conscience.
* Laws/Constitution:
  * More than moral in number, more specific, less flexible, narrower, faster to change
  * Turtles all the way down, laws are developed based on moral foundation
  * Enforced mainly by the government

I have often wondered in a well-functioning society, when a rule should be a law and when it should be a moral. It's not an easy question to answer but here are some random thoughts:

* A society with highly moral/responsible people can afford to have fewer laws because the people a will enforce the rule themselves either through social pressure and/or personal conscience. This has a significant benefit of reducing the cost of enforcement e.g lawyer, police, court, prison, etc. The downside is that moral relies on a overwhelming majority (>>50%) of society members adhering to it because it is so easily corrupted by just a small group of people with bad intentions. John Adams said, “Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.” This is why I am always worried about migration situation in the US. It can dilute the social trust and moral capital of the country quickly if not carefully controlled. The US has been able to afford to have high degree of individual freedom until now partially because its population was relatively religious a.k.a had a high degree of shared moral. If the moral of the society is diluted or no-longer shared, the government will have to step in to create and enforce laws. This will increase the cost of enforcement and reduce the freedom of the individual.

* Moral is also more flexible and broader. It is a system of loosely connected principles with vague priority order based on context. So people can depend on it to adapt their behaviors to a broader set of situations and changing circumstances. Law is much more rigid and in theory much more binary e.g right or wrong. E.g when a new technology like AI is invented, it's hard to know what laws should be made to regulate it and it will take time. But if people have a strong moral compass, they can use it to guide their behaviors in the meantime. It is also harder to accommodate a diverse group of people e.g harder for US than Japan, harder for large corporation than small startup. Basically, moral allows more grey area and more flexibility thus allow society or startup to develop technology faster because we can trust that people will do the right thing. Laws/regulations also has a huge associated cost. Its binary nature either violation or compliance can easily led to false positives a.k.a actions that violate the written law but is on the whole net positive to society.
