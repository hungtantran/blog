Recently, a younger friend asked me "What do you think makes a person interesting?" What an interesting question! For context, a few weeks ago, I suggested her that becoming interesting is a more worthy personal goal than becoming impressive. When I gave that advice, it seemed rather natural to me and didn't require much explanation. It came from my own personal experience meeting people. Interesting people are often more "interesting" than lots of "supposedly-impressive" people. However, if one really thinks about that statement, it is tautological; "interesting people" are, by definition, interesting. It is not any more insightful than saying that I like people who I find likable. Basically, to make sense of my first statement, I must articulate the answers to 3 questions:
1. What concrete characteristics do I think make a person interesting, and equally important, uninteresting?
2. What do I mean by "impressive people"? What make them often uninteresting?
3. Why becoming "interesting" is a better goal than becoming impressive?

Let's try to go through each of these question in this post:
1. What concrete characteristics that make a person interesting or uninteresting?
The hard part of this question is how to come up with answers that are simultaneously concrete, precise, accurate and not tautological. There are tons of content about this topic online. A simple Google search will gives you lots of articles, mostly from self-help or Buzzfeed-like of the online world. I tried to approach this from the first principle angle: "what makes anything interesting?" The answer is surprisingly simple: A thing is interesting if it is novel, rare, and different from other things that I'm used to. It's very context dependent. If I visit Paris for the first time, I will likely find the Eiffel tower novel and "interesting." The situation will probably be different if instead I have lived in Paris for 20 years.
