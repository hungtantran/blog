I once heard a joke that everyone has the same contrarian ideas. That sounds a bit surprising but on second thought, seems reasonable. Most people, including me, live in a bubble, small or large. Their contrarian ideas are usually contrarian only within or outside their bubble but rarely to both.

Having truly contrarian idea is a bit overrate these days, especially in tech, with the rising popularity of Peter Thiel and his brand of contrarian.

However, it's interesting to think about ideas that one has that seem contrarian. I will list in this post my ideas that I believe are somewhat unpopular:
* Moral principles are good guildlines 99% of the time. But in the 1% of the time when fundamental questions are in debate, moral should not be the final criteria. Increasing the survival probability of a group holding the moral principles should be the final criteria.
* War is necessary, and can be good in a sense. It serves a few functions 1) natural selections for ideas and genes 2) reminds societies of the meaning of life, reasons to live
* Good/bad/evil is not characteristic of objects, idea or people but a matter of quantity. Balance is important. Even "bad" things should not be completely eradicated to 0, but only reduced to a small enough amount, which is usually higher than most people assume. Stating in another way, everything is good in the right quantity, or there is an ideal quantity for everything.
