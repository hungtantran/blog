I once heard a joke that everyone has the same contrarian ideas. That sounds surprising but on second thought, it seems reasonable. Most people, including me, live in a bubble, small or large. Their contrarian ideas are usually contrarian only within or outside their bubble but rarely to both.

Having contrarian ideas is somewhat overrated these days, especially in tech, with the rising popularity of Peter Thiel and his brand of contrarianism.

However, it's interesting to think about ideas that one has that seem contrarian. I will list in this post my ideas that I believe are somewhat unpopular:
* Moral principles are good guidelines 99% of the time. But in the 1% of the time when fundamental questions are debated, morals should not be the final criteria. Increasing the survival probability of a group holding moral principles should be the ultimate criterion.
* Moral is only locally-applicable, rarely globally-applicable.
* War is necessary, and can be good in a sense. It serves a few functions 1) natural selections for ideas and genes 2) reminds societies of the meaning of life, reasons to live
* Good/bad/evil is not characteristic of objects, ideas, or people but a matter of quantity. Balance is important. Even "bad" things should not be completely eradicated to 0 but only reduced to a small enough amount, which is usually higher than most people assume. Stating in another way, everything is good in the right quantity, or there is an ideal quantity for everything.
* Except for some basic physiological needs like nutritious food, safety, ... all other human needs are relative, either to the recent past or to other people
* The long-term survival of one's gene is the ultimate goal. Nothing else should matter subjectively. This doesn't mean complete selfishness and abandonment of morality because that's a dump short-term and ineffective strategy to achieve that goal.
* It's debatable whether technological and social advancements since the Industrial Revolution are conducive to the long-term survival of humanity
