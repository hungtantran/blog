I have been wondering for a while if exists, what utopia would look like. There is no exact definition of utopia but I define it as a state in which everyone is always happy. I haven't come to a firm conclusion but my current belief is that utopia cannot exist because of a few fundamental characteristics of human nature:
* Human are social creature. They need to interact with other people to be happy. So utopia must have more than 1 person. However, almost all people desire status, which is zero-sum. That desire cannot be satisfied for everyone.
* In general, people needs change to be happy. If they are always happy, they will get bored and unhappy. The nature of change is unstable so the state of utopia cannot be sustained.
* People want meaning. Meaning is derived from solving problem. The bigger the problem is, the happier one is when solving it. So if there is no problem, there is no happiness. However, problem by itself causes discontent. So the state of happiness is inherently fleeting.
