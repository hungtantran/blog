I have worked at companies of many different sizes: from giants like Microsoft with more than 100k employees to startups like Vise with 100s employees, and everything in between, Google with tens of thousands of employees, Two Sigma, and Airtable with ~1-2k employees. From my experience, I can see why a small startup with much fewer but great engineers than larger companies can effectively compete against them. Here are some rough estimate to why:
 
* A great engineer can be 2-3x more productive than a good engineer. It is easier for a small team of great engineers to maintain a higher average caliber of engineers than a large team. It's just natural regression toward the mean.
* A highly motivated engineer can be 2-5x more productive than a not-so-motivated engineer. An engineer at a good startup is usually more self-selected to be more motivated than an average corporate engineer at FAANG.
* Corporate bureaucracy such as the need to achieve alignment between many different stakeholders, the communication cost, the many processes, maintain legacy code, manage migration projects in a big tech co can easily reduce the productivity of an engineer by 2-5x.
* Prioritization: tons of work and decisions at bigtech co ultimately optimize the business minimally at the margin. In the big picture, lots of them are not that important and can be eliminated without much impact on the overall business. I estimate at least 10-30% of bigtech engineers do that kind of work.
 
Taken together, a great, empowered, motivated engineer in a good startup like early Google, Facebook, Dropbox can be 10-100x more productive as a typical good, not-so-motivated engineer in a bureaucratic bigtech co. Given this, a startup with 10 great engineers can be as productive as a team of 1000s engineers. I can easily see how Whatsapp with only 32 engineers at the time of acquisition can achieve great things.
 
However, this doesn't mean that any random startup with 10 engineers can be as productive as a bigtech with 1000 engineers. First of all, it is still incredibly hard to recruit 10 great engineers to an early stage startup. Why would those engineers be willing to take so much risk and work so much? It usually comes down to the founder having a great vision, being able to sell it convincingly and most importantly, being a great engineer himself. Secondly, managing a team of great engineers is also incredibly hard. The founder needs to give them enough space, ownership, and responsibility to motivate them to produce great work but at the same time, keep them working toward a common goal of the company. Third, although all the corporate bureaucratic processes slow engineers down greatly, they also reduce the risk of some catastrophe happening due to accidental mistakes or personal blindspot. Ultimately, those processes are designed to reduce risk for the tradeoff of efficiency and productivity, which make sense for large companies.
