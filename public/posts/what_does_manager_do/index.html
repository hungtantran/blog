The measure of success of a manager is how well he can maximize output with the least amount of resources.\nThe above is the idealized version. In practices, lots of time, managers are judged by:\nHow well they present and make a case for their business impact than their actual impact.

The main source of leverages of managers to achieve above goals are, subjectively ranked in term of importance from most to least:\nSetting goals and directions: choosing the right goals, keeping focus, communicate clearly what they are, why they are important, success criteria Helping people more effective: Growing people: giving feedback, coaching, mentoring, giving opportunities Giving clear communications, give clarifications, avoid micromanagement, prevent organization distractions, prevent personal distraction Keeping people accountable Growing team: hiring more good people (be careful, this can increase cost) Some organizational authority to make the final decision in a discussion and to make people do certain things However, the above list is also roughly ranked in term of difficulty from most to least. That’s why managers are tempting to focus on the easier tasks, such as, hiring more people and avoid the harder tasks, such as, setting the right goals and directions.\nSome tasks that managers overuse:\nCreating process: at the right amount this can help people more effective. But for a senior team, this can be less effective. Too much of this will also be counterproductive. However, this is also the easiest because there are lots of templates on this to copy mechanically. Hiring more people: this is also not too hard if the company has lots of money and is growing, especially in tech. Micromanage: some amount of this for junior report is necessary and can make them more effective. But too much of this can be counterproductive. Force people to do things based on organizational authority. Leadership simply means leading others, having someone follow rather voluntarily. The main source of leverage of leaders to achieve this goal are settings directions and helping people grow, more effective. Basically, the hardest tasks of a manager. Leadership relies more on voluntary following than authority. Manager can rely on both leadership and authority.\n",

<p>Managers&rsquo; inputs are business goals and human resources. Outputs are business results. The measure of success of a manager is how well he can maximize output with the least amount of resources.</p>
<p>The above is the idealized version. In practices, lots of time, managers are judged by:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well they present and make a case for their business impact than their actual impact.</li>
<li>Personal relationship with upper management, peer and direct reports.</li>
<li>How much resources (people) they have/control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main source of leverages of managers to achieve above goals are, subjectively ranked in term of importance from most to least:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting goals and directions: choosing the right goals, keeping focus, communicate clearly what they are, why they are important, success criteria</li>
<li>Helping people more effective:
<ul>
<li>Growing people: giving feedback, coaching, mentoring, giving opportunities</li>
<li>Giving clear communications, give clarifications, avoid micromanagement, prevent organization distractions, prevent personal distraction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keeping people accountable</li>
<li>Growing team: hiring more good people (be careful, this can increase cost)</li>
<li>Some organizational authority to make the final decision in a discussion and to make people do certain things</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the above list is also roughly ranked in term of difficulty from most to least. That&rsquo;s why managers are tempting to focus on the easier tasks, such as, hiring more people and avoid the harder tasks, such as, setting the right goals and directions.</p>
<p>Some tasks that managers overuse:</p>
