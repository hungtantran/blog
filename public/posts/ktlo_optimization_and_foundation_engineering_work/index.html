Usually, they include oncall, small refactoring work to reduce internal technical debts.\nProduct optimization: these are the types of work that locally optimizes the existing product at the margin. They make the product better, more scalable, performant, and reliable. However, these works usually do not have the potential to make or break a product or business. These are one-to-N works, instead of zero-to-one works. Without them, the product still provides good value to a large number of users.\nThese works usually comprise 90% or more of engineering works at a tech company which already achieves product market fit (PMF). They include a broad range of works such as new incremental features (even large ones), product improvement, bug fixing, most infrastructure, platform works to increase the reliability, performance, scalability of existing products, migration projects. They can be super important work, accounting for a large part of a company’s continuing growth. Most of the highest-leverage engineering works in a post-PMF company are optimization works. They are usually more technical, technically challenging and more engineering-intensive than product-foundation works. Before achieving PMF, the company/team should not dedicate more than 20-30% of time on these. Optimizing a product before PMF is local optimization at a potentially very low point in the value curve. Product foundation: these are zero-to-one type of works. They are engineering work supporting clear product bets that can fundamentally decide whether a company has a product with values or not.\nBefore achieving product market fit, companies should dedicate 80% of engineering work to these, and should avoid too much time on product optimization works. Don’t spend too much time arguing and achieving alignment on minute UX, architecture or tooling details. It is easy to fall into the trap of optimizing, and discussing too much inconsequential decisions. The challenge is that product optimization works can be more fun technically than product foundation works. Lots of great engineers enjoy product optimization work more than product foundation works. Engineering might have less leverage compared to product/designer during this phase of the company/team. Some personal learnings based on the observation above are:\nIf you are on a pre-PMF company/team, spend time on product foundation works. If you are on a PMF company/team and want promotion/impact, spend time on product optimization works. Before joining a company/team, determine if it is pre- or post-PMF. If it is pre-PMF, see where the majority of engineers and engineering works are, if they are product optimization-heavy work (performance optimization, re-architecture, SRE, migration works), the company might not be well-run and might struggle with achieving PMF. If you like technically-challenging work, post-PMF companies and big tech might be a better fit. If you like making product impact, being scrappy, ok with potentially lots of short-term tradeoff between tech debt and velocity, pre-PMF company can be a good choice. ",
