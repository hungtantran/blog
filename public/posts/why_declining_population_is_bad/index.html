The source of these hot debates was, of course, Elon Musk. Throughout the years, Elon has stated on multiple occasions that he was concerned with low birth rate, and that civilization is going to crumble without more children. Many online voice questioned his claim. Some do not think that declining birthrate is an issue given that the world population is now close to 8 billions as of 2022.\nFailing birthrate do not mean just declining birthrate but also aging population. If the population declined from 8 billions now to 4 billions like it was in 1975, it wouldn’t have nearly the same age structure as it did then. Instead, it will have a much higher percentage of old people. That is a big big problem. Most of society’s productivity and resources will go to caring for old people who no longer produce or produce less goods and services. Basically, world’s resources will be less dedicated to creating new things, pushing new boundaries, discovering new knowledge. Instead, for better or worse, they will be dedicated more toward keeping unproductive people alive. Characterizing old people as unproductive people sounds mean and ungrateful. However, it is a fact. The resources here are not just material resources. They include human resources too. Young people will have to work more and harder to pay for old people’s needs through tax, caregiving, and products.\nWorse, a world with more old people mean a world with more political, cultural power in the hand of the elderly. Such world will naturally look backward more than forward and slowly degrade in term of culture and perspective. Having more burden and less power, the young will naturally resent the old. That can lead to political and social instability.\nWorse, the world population declines but it doesn’t decline uniformly geographically. Birthrate and population declines fastest in the richer part of the world. Not so much or even increasing in poorer countries. If this situation continues, two scenarios can happen. The first, rich countries will have to allow more immigration from poor countries. Even the US, a country with a long history, lots of experience and cultural capacity to absorb a large amount of immigrations, is struggling with many problems that multiculturalism brings, regardless of what the leftist woke activists say, problems ranging from decline social capital, civil society to polarized politics, growing inequality, divided society, just to name a few. Unless we can somehow learn to assimilate quickly a large amount of people from completely different background, I’m afraid such future will be one of constant social instability and conflicts. The second scenario: refugee and other form of illegal migrations. This will be similar to the first scenario but worst since it will involve tons of violence and human tragedy.\nOverall, I agree with Elon. A declining birthrate will be unlikely the paradise that environmentalist imagines. It will be a backward looking, conservative world, lack of hope, optimism, and full of conflicts and tragedies.\n",
