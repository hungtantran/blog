I recently stumbled upon an interesting [article](https://ourworldindata.org/us-life-expectancy-low) explaining why life expectancy in the US is lower than in other rich countries. My takeaways are that healthcare quality is far from the main culprit. The main ones in decreasing order of impact are:
 
* Smoking: This is mostly culture. The US used to smoke a lot more than other countries but peaked earlier. Given the lag of two to three decades between peak of smoking and peak of smoking mortality, hopefully, the US's smoking mortality rate will come down to the same level as other countries soon. I wonder how vaping will impact this trend though.
* Obesity: This is mostly culture, and some income inequality since poor people usually have less healthy diets.
* Homicides, opioid overdose, road accident, suicides: These are mostly culture, and some income inequality.
* Access to healthcare: This is more culture.
 
Note: by culture, I also mean politics since politics is a direct, albeit lagging, indicator of culture.
 
Nonetheless, the main question that I ponder from this is whether there is any upside for the US from having lower life expectancy. I know this is a horrible question to ask given that common morality prevents us from thinking that anything good can come out of innocent people's dying. However, just for the sake of it, I try to look at some potential unintended upside of this, otherwise, bad fact:
