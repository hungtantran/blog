      <description>After almost a decade working as a professional software engineer, I have seen that there are only a few fundamental levers that an engineer can use to make software more performant, either lower latency or higher through. I&amp;rsquo;d like to list them here and include tradeoff involving with each:
Pattern 1: Use faster or more hardware:
Common practices: Upgrade CPU, memory, network equipments, use custom ASIC, use more machines, use the cloud.</description>

      <title>Why declining population is bad</title>

      <description>Recently, there has been a lot of online discussions happening about falling birthrate, under population and whether it is a blessing or a curse. The source of these hot debates was, of course, Elon Musk. Throughout the years, Elon has stated on multiple occasions that he was concerned with low birth rate, and that civilization is going to crumble without more children. Many online voice questioned his claim. Some do not think that declining birthrate is an issue given that the world population is now close to 8 billions as of 2022.</description>

      <title>Why networking is so hard</title>

      <description>2 characteristics of networking: Distance and heterogeneity
Making the below problem harder compare to many other computer system components:
Performance: throughput, latency Performance requirement is real so many optimization is needed. Making the real world implementation of most networking component extra complicated. Reliability * Compatibility So many abstraction layer to solve the problem of Lack of control on so many component of the system Security Distance, lack of control, heterogeneity, lots of abstraction makes the issue of security much harder Because networking usually has to deal with transferring information over a much longer distance compare to other component in a computer system like CPU, GPU, memory, the above problems become much harder.</description>

      <title>Y chromosome and Son Preference</title>
      <link>http://betathinker.com/posts/son_preference_and_y_chromosome/</link>

      <guid>http://betathinker.com/posts/son_preference_and_y_chromosome/</guid>
      <description>Today, a question suddenly popped into my head: Does the preference for son common in many cultures have anything to do with the fact that Y chromosome passes virtually unchanged from father to son?
Many cultures around the world such as Chinese and Indian prefer sons over daughters. I am not a sociologist so I do not pretend to know if the historical cause of this phenomenon has been adequately explained or not.</description>

      <title>Podcast Takeaways: Sam Bankman-Fried - Creating a Perfect Market</title>
      <link>http://betathinker.com/posts/review_sam_bankman_fried_on_perfect_market/</link>

      <guid>http://betathinker.com/posts/review_sam_bankman_fried_on_perfect_market/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: My biggest takeaways is that cryptocurrency can potentially succeed because it can innovate without all the legacy system and intermediaries holding it back. Existing financial system doesn&#39;t have that luxury. It has nothing to do with technical feasibility. It has everything to do with legacy and momentum, a classic story of disruption.
ADHD as I am, I dislikes listening to podcast. The medium conveys information at a slower speed than what I can achieve with a written article.</description>

      <description>Since I became a Tech Lead Manager, I have been holding weekly 1:1s with my reports. While I had unofficially acted as a TLM for sometime now, the formality of my new title brought a whole new sense of responsbility. At the beginning, whenever my reports came to me with an issue, I felt an urge to come up with a perfect answer. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the point of me being manager if I could not solve my reports&amp;rsquo; issues?</description>

      <description>With the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russian force, people in Western and many Asian countries are united in condemning it.
War is necessary. War is just an extreme form of competition.
Advance humanity. Technology comes from war. Unite people at least on one side. There is no real collaboration without real competition. There is no extreme collaboration without extreme competition a.k.a war. War or a credible threat of war makes life more exciting, reminding people of value of life.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Concurrency in Go</title>

      <description>I recently finished reading the book &amp;ldquo;Concurrency in Go&amp;rdquo; by Katherine Cox-Buday. It is a relatively short book. A focused read can finish it in a few days. The content is relatively basic, convering a mix of concurrency fundamentals and specific patterns commonly found in Go concurrent code. Overall, for someone who is new to Go concurrent primitives, the book provides a good review.
A couple of new ideas that I learnt from the books are:</description>
